This is a basic Calculator Program for my Plp week 1 pyhton assignment


I created a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.

note: i noticed the calculator will crash if the user inputs a letter instead of a number. 
Solution not available yet, this is just a basic calculator.
